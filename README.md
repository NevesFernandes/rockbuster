<h2>RockBuster Stealth LLC Project</h2>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a fictional movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service to stay competitive.

<h3>Objective</h3>
Extract key insights from RockBusterâ€™s operational database to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service.
